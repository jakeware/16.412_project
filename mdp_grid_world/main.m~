%% Notes
% This is a test of a MDP solver on a grid world

%% Setup
n = 4;  % number of states
gamma = 0.9;  % dicount factor
epsilon = .01; % convergence treshold
goal_state = [4 4];

V = rand(n);
V(goal_state(1),goal_state(2)) = 1;
[X,Y] = meshgrid(1:n,1:n);

%% Analysis
while max(max(V_diff))>epsilon
  for k=1:numel(X)
    i = X(k);
    j = Y(k);
    if (i==goal_state(1) && j==goal_state(2))
      continue;
    end
    V(i,j) = + V(goal_state(1),goal_state(2));
  end
end
